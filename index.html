          Joined as an independent contractor in November of 2017, began doing feature work and in less than two months was offered a position as a full time engineer. From there I quickly took ownership of the existing backend infrastructure and became the primary backend developer, leading all backend and database architectural development. Promoted to Senior Engineer within a year and a half and made responsible for the entire backend API and database architecture across four major production applications. Later, in November of 2021, I was promoted to Director of Product Development where, as in addition to my backend engineer responsibilities, I was placed in charge of our entire Platform Team, leading the overall development of all our apps.
